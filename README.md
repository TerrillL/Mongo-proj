The main learning objective to this assignment was was to create a simple database similar to our express local library tutorial but on a smaller scale. This website would allow a user to add students and schools to the database and also link the students to the school. The layout was fairly simplistic and was just showing it in json format.

Overall, following this tutorial was relatively easy and I was able to get it to work for the most part. I had to do most of the work on my personal computer because the computers at the classroom were having issues running it. Overall, I only really had one big issue on this project and that was to get the schools listed in a select field on the html layout. I tried this a few different approachs but each approach I tried I always encounters some sort of error. For the time being and by the due date of this assignment, I left the select field empty and instead put a text field as its replacement. I hope to completely figure out selection box issue out as I'd like to apply these method on personal database websites similar to this.

Overall, I can  see the information that I've learned throughout this project directly applying to both school and work assignments whenever a standard json database will do the job. I look forward to applying this setup to future assignments and to advance my knowledge in the field.
